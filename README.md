Objective:
The goal is to analyze and visualize bakery revenue trends using dimensions such as order types, organic status, pie flavors, and pie types. 

Organic vs Non-Organic Revenue Trends:
Organic pies have a smaller share of total orders, but they generate a higher average revenue per order. This suggests that customers are willing to pay a premium for organic bakery products.

Pie Type Preferences: (Whole vs Slice Pies)
Whole pies generate the highest revenue, but slices are showing a growing trend, especially in online orders.

Revenue Trends by Day of the Week:
The ribbon chart highlights that weekends, especially Saturdays and Sundays, are the most profitable days, generating the majority of revenue.

Quarterly Revenue Trends:
The column chart shows that the 4th quarter (Octoberâ€“December) generates the highest revenue, driven largely by holiday season orders and seasonal pies.

DAX Measures and Data Model:
Calendar Table:
A DAX-based calendar table was created to facilitate time-based analysis.
